                <p class=" our-people-para-right">
                Born in Colva, south of Goa. Maria Suzette grew up in a Portuguese colonial house. She is the eldest amongst four siblings. Earlier times home food was devoured, besides that there was no other food placed on to the table. Our home food is nutritious and healthy. She completed her schooling and went to pursue her five years degree in fine art. Then she founded her own advertising agency with Rony Floriano and functioned for a decade at the beginning of her career. 
                </p>
                <p class=" our-people-para-right">
                    “Those early days, we realised the importance of home healthy food”. We realised the need to retain the same home cooked  cultures. To add to that Goa was loosing her culinary heritage, being a world visitors destination there was no one sketching Goa’s cuisine in a credible way. With an artist instinct she dedicate her talent and started in the year 1997, Mum’s Kitchen – Ethnic Cuisine Movement.  
                </p>
                <p class=" our-people-para-right">
                    Today this movement is alive and she is content for Goa’s culinary voice is heard in many countries. For her the on going continual campaign of ethnic movement is a testimony what an artist can bring in lasting impressions on a culinary canvas. Indeed Mum’s Kitchen art for her is inspiring and priceless.

                    Given an option to Rony Floriano to duplicate any existing setup or create one unique model he will settle for the latter one by indigenously creating from the grass root and finishing to the last bit in designing an organisation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="our-people-para-left"  >
                        Mum’s Kitchen is one model uniquely created different in the gourmet category. His management structures are optimal, with minimal control span, linear hierarchy in form of reverse pyramid.We call Mum’s Kitchen, and even in our brand guidelines (SOP) stating not to call a restaurant instead Mum’s Kitchen, the ethnic cuisine movement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="our-people-para-left" >
                        He steers the brand, in a 360 degree. His eye for detail is incapable, so as his skill in specialised process controls inventory management, Human Resources, consistency in food operations and creating a home cooking process model instead of other restaurants duplicated model.
